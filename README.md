Used: -Next.js with typescript and tailwind
      -d3.js

This project don't manipulate the DOM outside React. It does not uses useRef Hook because "React uses a fancy reconciliation algorithm to decide which DOM elements to update. It does this by creating a virtual DOM and diffing against the real DOM. When we mutate the DOM outside of React render methods, weâ€™re removing the performance benefits we get and will unnecessarily re-render elements." -Amelia Wattenberger in Fullstack Data Visualization with D3

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
